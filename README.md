# Infant Mortality Rate Analysis
This is a project I'm working on for my COMP 312 (Open Source Computing) class.

Iâ€™m interested in the health care field. Looking through the data available, I saw that there is a lot of information relating to birth statistics. I would like to look a the infant mortality rate and correlate that with socioeconomic factors, birth weight and access to prenatal care.

I will be looking at:

1. Is there a relationship between infant mortality rate and the socioeconomic hardship index?
2. Is there a relationship between infant mortality rate and prenatal care?
3. Is there a relationship between infant mortality rate and geographic location?
4. Lastly, I will look at the relationship between infant mortality rate and availability of Women, Infant, Children (WIC) clinics.
